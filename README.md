Game Project for EECS 205: Intro to Computer System Software

The game is called Pearl Collector, an under the sea adventure, that has the player collect pearls to advance.
If the player runs into an enemy fish with pearls, they lose all their progress and have to start over! If they run into an enemy without any pearls, then uh-oh, they die.
The player can drop a hook that will kill an enemy, but they only have one of these, and once it's been taken by a fish, it's gone!
