# Northwestern EECS 205 Winter 2018
## *Game Project for EECS 205: Intro to Computer System Software*


### Summary
The game is called Pearl Collector, an under the sea adventure, that has the player collect pearls to advance.
If the player runs into an enemy fish with pearls, they lose all their progress and have to start over! If they run into an enemy without any pearls, then uh-oh, they die.
The player can drop a hook that will kill an enemy, but they only have one of these, and once it's been taken by a fish, it's gone!

### Background
Created as a final project for Northwestern's EECS 205 class, this game is coded completely in x86 assembly. It features sound, collisions, and random spawning. 


*I do not own the art or music used in the game. They were all found with free-to-use licenses.*
